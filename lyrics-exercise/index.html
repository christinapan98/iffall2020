                            Nightswimming deserves a quiet night <br>
                            The photograph on the dashboard, taken years ago <br>
                            Turned around backwards so the windshield shows <br>
                            Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse <br>
                            Still, it's so much clearer <br>
                            I forgot my shirt at the water's edge <br>
                            The moon is low tonight <br>
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            Nightswimming deserves a quiet night <br>
                            I'm not sure all these people understand <br>
                            It's not like years ago <br>
                            The fear of getting caught <br>
                            Of recklessness and water <br>
                            They cannot see me naked <br>
                            These things, they go away <br>
                            Replaced by everyday <br>
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            Nightswimming, remembering that night <br>
                            September's coming soon <br>
                            I'm pining for the moon <br>
                            And what if there were two <br>
                            Side by side in orbit <br>
                            Around the fairest sun? <br>
                            That bright, tight forever drum <br>
                            Could not describe nightswimming <br>
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            You, I thought I knew you <br>
                            You I cannot judge <br>
                            You, I thought you knew me <br>
                            This one laughing quietly underneath my breath <br>
                            Nightswimming <br>
                        </p>
                           
                        <p>
                            The photograph reflects, every streetlight a reminder <br>
                            Nightswimming deserves a quiet night, deserves a quiet night <br>
                        </p>
