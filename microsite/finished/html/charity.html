				LVMH places a high value on art and culture and demonstrates this through regular donations. “Right from the creation of LVMH, I clearly established support for the arts and culture as a key component in our development. Our commitment embodies the values that all our Maisons share – savoir-faire, excellence and creativity – and anchors them in their artistic, cultural and social environment.”- Bernard Arnault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LVMH.
