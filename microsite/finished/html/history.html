				<p class="hist-intro">
					In the 1990s, Bernard Arnault had the idea to
					create a group of luxury brands. The Dapifer
					reported that LVMH would gain ownership of
					Chistian Dior haute couture, leather, both
					men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, and
					footwear lines. Arnault’s successful integration
					of various famous aspirational bransinto a
					single group has inspired other luxury
					comapnies to do the same.
