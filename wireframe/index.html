			<h1> Japanese Milk Bread Rolls</h1>
			<p>
				Also referred to as Hokkaido milk bread, these rolls are incredibly soft and airy thanks to a simple technique involving a roux "starter," known as tangzhong. The roux is mixed into the final dough, producing wonderfully soft, tender bread.
			</p>
			<p>
				This recipe was one of the first ones I tried this summer and will give you foolproof bread every time. Just be prepared to knead--the first time I made it, it took over an hour and my arms were sore the next day!

				<h2>Tangzhong(starter)</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>3 tablespoons (43g) water</li>
					<li>3 tablespoons (43g) whole milk</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons (14g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Dough</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>2 1/2 cups (298g) King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons(14g) Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk</li>
					<li>1/4 cup (50g) sugar</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon instant yeast</li>
					<li>1/2 cup (113g) whole milk</li>
					<li>1 large egg</li>
					<li>4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>To make the tangzhong: Combine all of the ingredients in a small saucepan, and whisk until no lumps remain.</li>

					<li>Place the saucepan over low heat, and cook the mixture, whisking constantly, until thick and the whisk leaves lines on the bottom of the pan, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>

					<li>Transfer the tangzhong to a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and let it cool to room temperature.</li>

					<li>To make the dough: Combine the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients, then mix and knead — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until a smooth, elastic dough forms.</li>

					<li>Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased covered bowl for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.</li>

					<li>Gently deflate the dough, divide it into 8 equal pieces, and shape each piece into a ball.</li>

					<li>Place the rolls into a lightly greased 8" or 9" round cake pan. Cover the pan, and let the rolls rest for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy. </li>

					<li> Preheat the oven to 350°F. Brush the rolls with milk or egg wash (1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water), and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown on top; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the middle roll should read at least 190°F.</li>

					<li>Remove the rolls from the oven. Allow them to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.</li>

			<h2>Tips from our bakers</h2>
			<p>With origins in Japan's yukone (or yudane), tangzhong is a yeast bread technique popularized across Asia by Chinese cookbook author Yvonne Chen. Tangzhong involves cooking some of a bread recipe’s flour in liquid prior to adding it to the remaining dough ingredients. Bringing the temperature of the flour and liquid to 65°C (149°F) pre-gelatinizes the flour’s starches, which makes them more able to retain liquid — thus enhancing the resulting loaf’s softness and shelf life.</p>

			<p>To make a loaf: After the dough's initial rise, divide it into four equal pieces. Flatten each piece into a rectangle, then fold the short ends in towards one another like a letter. Flatten the folded pieces into rectangles again and, starting with a short end, roll them each into a log. Place the logs in a row of four — seam side down and side by side — in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan. Cover the loaf and allow it to rest/rise for 40 to 50 minutes, until puffy. Brush the loaf with milk or egg wash and bake at 350°F for about 30 minutes, until golden brown on top and a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf reads at least 190°F. Remove the loaf from the oven, and cool it on a rack.</p>

			<p>This soft dough lends itself beautifully to fried doughnuts. After the dough has risen once, hop on over to our Yeast-Raised Doughnuts recipe and start at step #3 to see how it's done.</p>
