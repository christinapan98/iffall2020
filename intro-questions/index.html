        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                I'm Christina Pan, a senior double majoring in CS 
                and Communication Design.
            </li>
            <li>
                Though I already have experience with HTML/CSS/JS, I want to
                learn more about using these languages from a design standpoint.
            </li>
            <li>
                Yes, I've taken classes through the CS department and have also used 
                React and Angular before.
            </li>
            <li>
                I hope to learn more about ways that users can interact with webpages such as animations
                or 3D effects. Website design is unique because it is not static, but rather changes
                based on the needs of the user. By looking at a site
                through the eyes of a designer rather than a developer, I aim to learn more ways
                to improve user experiences.

                On a screen, one must design for different browser sizes like
                tablet/phone views.
            </li>
            <li>
                    I think <a href="https://www.mica.edu/">MICA's</a> site is very well designed for its clear layout and 
                    attention to detail. Its landing page allows the user to easily access
                    the latest news, while the sidebar ensures that he/she can access information
                    about MICA at all times and is never lost in the site. The accents of color
                    and squiggly underlines around the page also communicate the creative spirit
                    of MICA.
            </li>
            <li>
                    I think <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">this</a> site communicates well because it organizes a huge
                    amount of information in a way that is accessible and easily understood
                    by the user. Every page in the site has a clear hierarchy, and the clean font and 
                    comfortable viewing size ensure the user can read the information. The width of
                    each line is also not too long or too short, making it easy for the viewer's eyes
                    to move from line to line.
            </li>
            <li>
                    <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> works well because its minimalist, image-heavy interface allows
                    the user to focus primarily on searching for new ideas without being distracted
                    by who is sharing the idea. Something else that makes it effective is the way 
                    it brings you new pins based on your search history and saved pins.
