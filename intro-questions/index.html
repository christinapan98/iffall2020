        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                I'm Christina Pan, a senior double majoring in CS 
                and Communication Design.
            </li>

                Though I already have experience with HTML/CSS/JS, I want to
                learn more about using these languages from a design standpoint.
            </li>
            <li>
                Yes, I've taken classes through the CS department and have also taught myself
                a few things.
            </li>
            <li>
                I hope to learn good design practices for websites.
            </li>

                On a screen, one must design for different browser sizes like
                tablet/phone views.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.mica.edu/"></a>
                <p>
                    I think MICA's site is very well designed for its clear layout and 
                    attention to detail. Its landing page allows the user to easily access
                    the latest news, while the sidebar ensures that he/she can access information
                    about MICA at all times and is never lost in the site. The accents of color
                    and squiggly underlines around the page also communicate the creative spirit
                    of MICA.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I think this site communicates well because it organizes a huge
                    amount of information in a way that is accessible and easily understood
                    by the user. 
                </p>
            </li>

                <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/"></a>
                <p>
                    Pinterest works well because its minimalist, image-heavy interface allows
                    the user to focus primarily on searching for new ideas without being distracted
                    by who is sharing the idea. Something else that makes it effective is the way 
                    it brings you new pins based on your search history and saved pins.
